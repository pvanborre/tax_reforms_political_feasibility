# Installation 

Please look at the installation instructions of this other repository (https://github.com/pvanborre/openfisca_married_couples?tab=readme-ov-file) :
In short, following these instructions will make you convert your input data (SAS files containing ERFS-FPR surveys) to input datatables consumables by the microsimulation model OpenFisca. Moreover, these instructions create a Docker image that is used to ensure better reproductibility of results (specifies versions for Python and its modules, tags of the OpenFisca repositories). 

TODO put command to launch the docker container
